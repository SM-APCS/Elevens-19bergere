1. List all possible plays for the board 5♠ 4♥ 2♦ 6♣ A♠ J♥ K♦ 5♣ 2♠

5♠ and 6♣, 6♣ and 5♣

2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?

Yes because the deck is empty and that means all of the number cards are paired and all of the face card trios have made made except for one.

3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.

Yes it helps to choos a J,Q,K trio over a pair because it will generate three new cards not two and open up new combinations.
